A BOM manager designed to interface with Eagle's BOM ULP scripts.

Scrapes product information off of distributor product pages.
All BOM and product information is stored in a local sqlite3 database compressed using y_serial.  

The latest version of the BOM-AM and BOM-EX ULP scripts are available at:
http://www.cadsoftusa.com/downloads/ulps
Note that the basic bom.ulp script bundled with Eagle is not supported, BOM-AM and BOM-EX both work.

Required third-party Python (2.7) modules:
Beautiful Soup: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
PyGTK: http://www.pygtk.org/

Importing data:
Export a CSV file from either BOM script with the following columns (no column headers):
Name, Value, Device, Package, Description

The file should have one component per line -- do not group components by value in the ULP.
