A BOM manager designed to interface with Eagle's BOM ULP scripts.

Scrapes product information off of distributor product pages.
All BOM and product information is stored in a local sqlite3 database.  

The latest version of the BOM-AM, bom_w_attr, and BOM-EX ULP scripts are available at:
http://www.cadsoftusa.com/downloads/ulps
Note that while the basic bom.ulp script bundled with Eagle is not supported at this time due to lack of features, BOM-AM, bom_w_attr, and BOM-EX all work.

Required third-party Python (2.7) modules:
Beautiful Soup: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
PyGTK: http://www.pygtk.org/

Importing data:
Export a CSV file from either BOM script with the following columns:
Name, Value, Device, Package, Description

Other part attributes from Eagle can be placed in additional columns. A column header row is required in this case.

The file should have one component per line -- do not group components by value in the ULP.
